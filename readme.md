# VAULT Metadata Schema

Tree-like view of [VAULT](https://vault.cca.edu)'s (heavily modified) MODS metadata schema. Meant to keep track of what fields are used for, how they connect with controlled vocabularies (i.e. EQUELLA taxonomies), local eccentricities.

## Details

Uses Bootstrap Tree: https://github.com/jhfrench/bootstrap-tree

There's a script to sync the GitHub pages branch but I use a post-commit hook which is also included; copy post-commit.sh into .git/hooks/ to do the same.
